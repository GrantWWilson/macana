Notes for AzTEC C++ pipeline (codename macana)


1. INSTALATION NOTES

1.1 REQUISITES:

	You will require a C++ compiler, cvs, and the following libraries must be on your system to compile the aztec_c++ pipeline:
	
	*OpenMp
	*GSL
	*FFTW3
	*CSparseX
	*netcdf
	*ccfits
	
	On Debian/Ubuntu based system you can install them with the following line:
	
		sudo apt-get install build-essential libfftw3-dev libgsl0-dev libsuitesparse-dev libnetcdf-dev libccfits-dev  cvs
		
		
1.2 Getting the pipeline:

	This is basically a copy from IDL instructions:
	
		1) If you don't have a file called .cvspass in your directory, run the following command
			touch .cvspass

		2) Login to the cvs server.  After executing this command you will see a prompt for the password ("CVS password: "), simply press the Enter key.
			cvs -d:pserver:anon@cdl.astro.umass.edu:/usr/local/cvsroot login

		3) To download the software the first time: Check out aztec_c++. 
			cd ~
			cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anon@cdl.astro.umass.edu:/usr/local/cvsroot co aztec_c++

	the last instruction will checkout the pipeline into the folder aztec_c++ directly to your home folder

1.3 Compiling

	macana is configured to compile with g++. If you want to use another C++ compiler you must open the Makefile on aztec_c++ folder and set the CC variable to the compiler executable:
	For example you can use the Intel C++ Compiler if you set the first line of the Makefile to
		CC=icc
	
	Now just clean and compile the code:
		
		cd ~/aztec_c++
		make clean
		make
	
	This will create two executable in the ~/aztec_c++ folder:
		macana		The data reduction pipeline itself
		fitswriter	An utility to convert pipeline output from NetCDF to FITS

1.4 Environment variables

	It is recommended to setup a couple of environment variables if you are using a bash-like terminal open your .bashrc (or .profile) file and add
	
	export AZTEC_MACANA_PATH="$HOME/aztec_c++"
	export PATH="$PATH:AZTEC_MACANA_PATH"
	
	if you are using a csh-like terminal then add the following line to yous .cshrc file:
	
	setenv AZTEC_MACANA_PATH $HOME/aztec_c++
	setenv PATH $PATH:AZTEC_MACANA_PATH

1.5 Python Utilities setup

	If you want to use FRUIT code you will need to setup the python environment. You will require numpy, scipy, python netcdf library and astropy. 
	It is recomended to have ipython running also
	
	On a Debian/Ubuntu distribution you can install them with the following line:
		
		sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy python-netcdf python-ipython pip
		
	astropy is not part of Debian/Ubuntu so you need to use pip or easy_install to get it:
		
		sudo pip install astropy

	Now you just need to setup your PYTHONPATH environment variable,
	
		export PYTHONPATH="$PYTHONPATH:$AZTEC_MACANA_PATH/python" 		#For bash-like
	or
		setenv PYTHONPATH $PYTHONPATH:$AZTEC_MACANA_PATH/python			#For csh-like
		
	
	Now reopen your terminal and test the installation:
	
		ipython
		from aztec import *
	
	You must see no errors.
